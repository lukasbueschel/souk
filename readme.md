This [Processing](http://processing.org) sketch was developed during the workshop RE_ORIENT at [ISEA2014](http://www.isea2014.org/).

> This Second International AUD/TUD Intermedia Technology Workshop, organized by the Department of Visual Communication at the American University in Dubai (AUD) with colleagues from the Media Design Department at the Technical University Dresden (TUD), will focus on the acquisition and processing of data deriving from the behaviour of highly heterogeneous, dynamic cultural systems / crowds. The workshop will also explore how to transform this data into significant visual expressions relevant for navigation and orientation. Visual and artistic perception will round off the program. During this intensive one-week workshop directed by AUD and TUD faculty, a select group of AUD students working with their peers from TUD and from Zayed University will use the latest technology to create projects addressing the themes of active vision and community spaces.

## Credits

The code regarding the particles path following algorithm was taken from [Example 6.6: Path following](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-6-autonomous-agents/#chapter06_example6) in [The Nature of Code](http://natureofcode.com/) by Daniel Shiffman.

Initial particle generation code was taken from [Particle trails, much more fluidlike (sketch_jul06c)](http://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/10825) by Chris Hodapp.
